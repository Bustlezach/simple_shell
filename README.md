Simple shell. A simple homemade version of the shell program. This project was completed as part of the requirements of the first quarter of the ALX SE program.

A shell is a computer program that verifies that the user's command is correct and it takes the command input from a user through a keyboard and passes it to the machine to execute it through the kernel.

BUILD WITH: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o Gsh *.c

The project was co-author with Iweze Odion Emmanuel.
